# Project Summary
For this assignment, we had to create a HTML5 Website which included a range of specific requirements. Most of these requirements derived from our lab work and from previous years and modules which aided me to complete this assignment to the best of my ability. From this module I have learnt that when you design and create a website you must consider the architecture and your potential users. A website should allow users to navigate around the site effortlessly. Below are the requirements for the website and my development process, along with issues faced and how I resoled them and my user testing.

###Requirements
 - validity and standards-compliance of the source code

 - correct and well-formed HTML5 code structure

 - consistent code indentation (2 spaces is best)

 - creative use of CSS3 features

 - effective and/or creative use of JavaScript

 - evidence of any user testing and resulting changes

 - effectiveness of navigation, information architecture, interaction design and accessibility/usability

 - coherence of general design, including images at correct size and CSS styles and effects

 - quality of content and suitability for proposed audience

 - good understanding of all code

 - creative use of available technologies

# Development
I started developing my website by using the code availbel from the lab work that I had done
on and using that code I started to create a base for my website and from there on 
I added the diffrent content that was required. I clearly knew whar I wanted on the webpages becasue I hade told Dave in 
my labs that I will be creating a website with these features and it will include certain things.

# Issues solved & faced
From the first design of my website assignment neither of my pages were responsive except my navigation bar. I showed and explained this to my teacher and they suggested that I should start again.

I took it upon myself to go on w3schools; I searched for template websites where the navigation bar was responsive. I managed to find one, I started to design my website according to the template I found online. When I implemented the code following my new PowerPoint design, I still had some issues with getting the website to be responsive on mobile first. I showed this website to my teacher, and they helped me make some of my website pages responsive which enabled me to do it thereafter.

From here, I completed my homepage and made it mobile first responsive. However, when it came to tablet responsive, it just was not responding. I went back to my teacher and told her I could not make my website tablet view responsive - she looked at it and tried, but she also could not rectify the situation. She suggested that I should look through the blackboard lab work to help me solve this problem. Whilst looking at the lab examples I saw an example which I liked, and I used that same layout for my website. I added the content one at a time and whilst doing that I kept on making it mobile/tablet/desktop responsive. By doing this it enabled me to make my whole website responsive as I was doing it along the way, rather than at the end.

Another issue I faced was with my slide show on my “Services” page. At first, it was not working, this is because I incorporated two slide shows in one page. This issue had me bewildered for a decent amount of time as I could not figure out what the problem was. Therefore, I eventually decided to code the slide show in a way that when the first one finishes, the other slide show starts.

I encountered another issue whereby my API was not working. I asked my teacher for some guidance and they suggested I add the script code at the bottom of the page, instead of adding it on the top. When I moved script code to the bottom of the website near the end body tag, the API start working.



#### 5. User testing

· I asked two of my peers to test my website. The first person was someone who’s career goals are an aspiring business owner and the other person was someone that doesn’t really know much about business.

· The aspiring business owner found using the website easy and mentioned that “it included majority of what I would be looking for if I need a consultant”

· They found the slide show on the “services” page engaging and really liked the YouTube video and my connections links to other investment companies. Overall, they were satisfied with the content.

· The other tester liked the navigation of the website and enjoyed how it was all in a single website.

· They noticed that the responsiveness on the services page seemed slightly off, but nonetheless still found it nice to read on mobile view.
